**Infrastructure Projects in India -Time taken to secure environmental clearance**

**Data**:  
PARIVESH (Pro-Active and Responsive facilitation by Interactive, Virtuous, and Environmental Single-window Hub) is a **government e-governance portal** designed for online submission, monitoring, and tracking of approvals for:  
- **Environmental Clearance (EIA Notification, 2006)**  
- **Forest Clearance (Forest Conservation Act, 1980)**  
- **Wildlife Clearance (Wildlife Protection Act, 1972)**  
- **CRZ Clearance (CRZ Notification, 2011)**  


The portal streamlines clearance processes by integrating them under a single platform, providing features like **unique project IDs**, and automatic notifications to minimize delays. Despite these advancements, the **interlinked and complex approval system often causes significant delays**, impacting both environmental sustainability and economic development.  

**What do you find here?**:  
- **Data Extraction**: Automated scraping code of clearance-related data from [PARIVESH Portal](https://parivesh.nic.in/#/).  
- **Key Data Points**: Collects data on project initiation, clearance requests, granted clearance times, and project timelines.  
- **Some Statistics around the Data**

**Objective**:  
This repository aims to **analyze the impact of environmental clearances on both the economy and ecology** by leveraging data scraped from the **PARIVESH portal**. Infrastructure projects in India often encounter delays due to **bureaucratic inefficiencies in the clearance process**, impacting sustainable development. By studying key project milestones like initiation, clearance requests, approval times, and completion dates, this project seeks to identify bottlenecks and their implications for economic growth and ecological balance.
