### GitHub Project: PARIVESH Data Scraping and Analysis  

**Objective**:  
This project aims to **analyze the impact of environmental clearances on both the economy and ecology** by leveraging data scraped from the **PARIVESH portal**. Infrastructure projects in India often encounter delays due to **bureaucratic inefficiencies in the clearance process**, impacting sustainable development. By studying key project milestones like initiation, clearance requests, approval times, and completion dates, this project seeks to identify bottlenecks and their implications for economic growth and ecological balance.  

**Background**:  
PARIVESH (Pro-Active and Responsive facilitation by Interactive, Virtuous, and Environmental Single-window Hub) is a **government e-governance portal** designed for online submission, monitoring, and tracking of approvals for:  
- **Environmental Clearance (EIA Notification, 2006)**  
- **Forest Clearance (Forest Conservation Act, 1980)**  
- **Wildlife Clearance (Wildlife Protection Act, 1972)**  
- **CRZ Clearance (CRZ Notification, 2011)**  

The portal streamlines clearance processes by integrating them under a single platform, providing features like **unique project IDs, Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**, and automatic notifications to minimize delays. Despite these advancements, the **interlinked and complex approval system often causes significant delays**, impacting both environmental sustainability and economic development.  

**Features of the Project**:  
- **Data Extraction**: Automates scraping of clearance-related data from [PARIVESH Portal](https://parivesh.nic.in/#/).  
- **Key Data Points**: Collects data on project initiation, clearance requests, granted clearance times, and project timelines.  
- **Impact Analysis**: Examines how delays and approvals affect economic progress and ecological conservation.  

**Usage**:  
- **Step 1**: Register on PARIVESH to apply for environmental clearances.  
- **Step 2**: Use the scraping tool to gather clearance and project timeline data.  
- **Step 3**: Analyze the data to evaluate the economic and ecological implications of delays or approvals.  

**Why This Project Matters**:  
By integrating insights into clearance delays and their dual impact on **economy and ecology**, this project offers a comprehensive understanding of bottlenecks in sustainable development.  

**Contribute**: Fork the repository, enhance the scraping or analysis tools, and join us in exploring the **intersection of environmental governance, economic growth, and ecological balance**!
